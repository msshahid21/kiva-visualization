# Kiva Loans Visualization Project - Codecademy

## Overview

This project required me to use jupyter notebook to create a report analysing the loans given out by Kiva within underdeveloped countries. With the use of python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, visualizations were created to show that there is a disparity in loan amounts received by male applicants as compared to female applicants within the countries. Additionally, there is also variations in loan amounts discussed that are on a country level as well. This project aims to answer questions around this disparity.
